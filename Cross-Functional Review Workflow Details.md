### Cross-Functional Review Workflow Details

#### Step 1: Team Assignment

*   **Page**: Cross-Functional Review Dashboard
*   **Page Slug**: `/cross-functional-review`
*   **Section 1: Team Assignment**
    *   **Functionality**: Based on the nature of the deviation as determined during the initial reviews, the system assigns the deviation to the relevant departments. This might include departments such as Quality Assurance, Production, Safety, etc.
    *   **Role Associated**: QA Manager, Production Manager, Safety Manager (depending on the deviation type).

#### Step 2: Collaboration

*   **Page**: Cross-Functional Review Form
*   **Page Slug**: `/cross-functional-review-form`
*   **Section 2: Collaboration**
    *   **Fields**:
        *   **Department Comments**: Each department head or designated reviewer can enter comments specific to their department's perspective on the deviation (max 5000 characters).
        *   **Action Requests**: Departments can request further investigations, corrective actions, or provide specific instructions on addressing the deviation.
    *   **Role Associated**: Department Reviewers (Multiple departments involved).
    *   **Functionality**: Reviewers from each assigned department can view and comment on the deviation. Each comment section is clearly labeled by the department name to organize feedback and action requests efficiently.

#### Step 3: Consolidation

*   **Page**: Deviation Response Formulation Page
*   **Page Slug**: `/deviation-response-formulation`
*   **Section 3: Consolidation**
    *   **Fields**:
        *   **Consolidated Response Plan**: A text area where the lead reviewer (typically from QA) synthesizes all departmental feedback into a comprehensive response plan (max 5000 characters).
        *   **Final Decision Options**: Radio buttons for decision-making:
            *   **Proceed to CAPA/Investigation**: Initiates a Corrective and Preventative Action or further investigation if required.
            *   **Close Deviation**: Closes the deviation if it is determined that no further action is necessary.
    *   **Role Associated**: QA Head or Lead Reviewer.
    *   **Submission**: The lead reviewer submits the consolidated response plan which then triggers the next appropriate action based on the decision taken.

### Notes:

*   **Interactive Dashboard Functionality**: The cross-functional dashboard allows each department to access the deviations assigned to them, with features to filter and sort based on urgency, date, or status.
*   **Real-Time Collaboration Tools**: Integration of tools like comments, tagging, and notifications to ensure all parties can collaborate effectively and in real time.
*   **Audit Trail and Security**: Strict access controls and detailed logging ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify the deviation details, maintaining a full audit trail for compliance purposes.

This workflow allows for a thorough and collaborative review of deviations by various functional areas within the organization, ensuring that all relevant factors are considered before progressing to action planning or closure.

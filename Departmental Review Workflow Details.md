            *   **Return**: Sends the deviation back to the initiator for additional information or corrections.
            *   **Reject**: Terminates the deviation process if found to be invalid or resolved without need for further action.

#### Step 3: Follow-up

                *   **Updated Information**: Sections from the Deviation Initiation Form that need revision will be re-presented for updates.
            *   **Role Associated**: Initiator.
            *   **Submission**: Upon completion, the initiator resubmits the form, which is then rerouted back to the departmental review dashboard for a new review.
    *   **If Approved**:
        *   **System Process**: Automatically forwards the deviation report to the cross-functional review stage.
        *   **Role Associated**: System/backend process to manage the routing based on the department head's decision.

### Notes:

*   **Review Dashboard Functionality**: The department head has a dashboard that lists all pending reviews, with functionalities to sort, filter, and access each deviation report directly.
*   **Notification System**: The system notifies department heads when a new deviation is assigned and notifies initiators when their deviation has been returned or needs resubmission.
*   **Audit Trail**: Every action on the deviation form, including comments, decisions, and timestamps, is logged to maintain a comprehensive audit trail.

This workflow ensures that deviations are promptly and effectively reviewed at the departmental level, incorporating necessary checks and balances before involving broader cross-functional teams. It facilitates accountability and ensures that deviations are handled according to procedural and compliance standards.

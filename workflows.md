Here's a markdown representation of the workflows in the deviation management application:

### Workflow Overview

1.  **Deviation Initiation Workflow**
    
    *   **Trigger:** Occurrence of an event that deviates from standard procedures.
    *   **User Action:** User logs into the system and fills out the deviation initiation form, providing detailed information about the deviation.
    *   **System Action:** The system generates a unique deviation number and records the date of initiation. If the deviation report is initiated after a 24-hour delay from identification, a justification for the delay is required.
    *   **Submission:** User submits the form for departmental review.
2.  **Departmental Review Workflow**
    
    *   **Review Assignment:** The deviation is automatically routed to the initiating department's head for initial review.
    *   **Review Actions:** The department head can approve, return for more information, or reject the deviation entry.
    *   **Follow-up:** If returned, the initiator must address the feedback and resubmit. If approved, it moves to the cross-functional review stage.
3.  **Cross-Functional Review Workflow**
    
    *   **Team Assignment:** Deviation is assigned to relevant departments based on the nature of the deviation (e.g., Quality Assurance, Production, Safety).
    *   **Collaboration:** Each department reviews the deviation, provides comments, and may request additional investigations or corrective actions.
    *   **Consolidation:** All feedback is consolidated, and a comprehensive response plan is formulated.
4.  **Investigation and CAPA Workflow**
    
    *   **Investigation Trigger:** Based on the risk assessment and nature of the deviation, an investigation is initiated.
    *   **Investigation Process:** Utilizes tools like 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagrams, and others to determine root causes.
    *   **CAPA Planning:** Corrective and Preventive Actions are defined and assigned to appropriate stakeholders.
    *   **Implementation and Monitoring:** CAPA actions are implemented, and their effectiveness is monitored over time to ensure resolution.
5.  **Closure and Documentation Workflow**
    
    *   **Closure Criteria:** Once all actions are completed satisfactorily and verified by QA, the deviation can be closed.
    *   **Documentation:** All steps from initiation to closure are documented for future reference and regulatory compliance.
    *   **Audit Trail:** A complete audit trail of all actions and decisions is maintained.
6.  **Reporting and Analysis Workflow**
    
    *   **Reporting:** Regular reports are generated detailing all deviations, ongoing actions, and statuses.
    *   **Trend Analysis:** The system analyzes data to identify trends that might indicate underlying systemic issues.
    *   **Continuous Improvement:** Insights from trend analysis are used to drive improvements in processes and training.

### Visualization

Imagine each of these workflows as part of a larger flowchart:

*   Each workflow step is a node.
*   Decisions (e.g., review outcomes like approve or reject) branch from these nodes.
*   Sequential actions (e.g., from initiation to departmental review) are connected by arrows showing the flow of the process.
*   Conditional paths (e.g., if investigations are required based on risk assessment scores) create forks in the workflow, leading to different follow-up actions.

This structured approach ensures that deviations are managed systematically, with clear accountability and traceability, enhancing the organization's ability to maintain high standards of quality and compliance.
